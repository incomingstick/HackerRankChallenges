# Pairs
Given **_N_** integers, count the number of pairs of integers whose difference is **_K_**.

## Input Format

The first line contains **_N_** and **_K_**.  
The second line contains **_N_** numbers of the set. All the **_N_** numbers are unique.

## Output Format

An integer that tells the number of pairs of integers whose difference is **_K_**.

## Constraints:
**_N_ <= 10^5**  
**0 < _K_ < 10^9**  
Each integer will be greater than **0** and at least **_K_** smaller than **2^31 - 1**.

## Sample Input
```
5 2  
1 5 3 4 2  
```
## Sample Output
```
3
```
## Explanation
