# Let's Echo
Write a bash script which does just one thing: saying "HELLO".
## Input Format 
There is no input file required for this problem.

## Output Format 
HELLO

## Sample Output 
HELLO

## A quick introduction to 'Echo' 
This is the equivalent of common output commands in most programming language (print or puts statements).

_For Example:_  
```
echo "Greetings"
```  
This outputs just one word "Greetings" (without the quotation marks).
```
echo "Greetings $USER, your current working directory is $PWD"
```
This picks up the values of the environment variables  and  and displays something like:
```
Greetings prashantb1984, your current working directory is /home/prashantb1984
```
The above message, of course, will vary from system to system, depending on the setting of environment variables.
